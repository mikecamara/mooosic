If you work 8 hours per day, the total time to complete the project with the updated estimates would be:

1. Set up the project environment: 0.5 day
2. Design the UI: 1 day
3. Implement the main components: 1.5 days
4. Connect to the iTunes Search API: 1 day
5. Implement app functionality: 2 days
6. Write tests: 1.5 days
7. Optimize performance and user experience: 1 day
8. Implement security best practices: 1 day
9. Prepare for deployment: 1 day
10. Create documentation: 0.5 day
11. Deploy the app: 0.5 day
    </br>

**Total:** 11 days

</br>

Given that each day consists of 8 hours of work, the total time required to complete the project would be **88 hours** (11 days \* 8 hours per day). Keep in mind that these estimates can still vary depending on factors such as experience, interruptions, and unforeseen challenges.
