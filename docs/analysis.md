# Mooosic App Analysis Document

## Introduction:
The Mooosic App is a simple music player that allows users to search for artists by name using the iTunes Search API. This document outlines the strategy and approach for implementing the app, considering the requirements, constraints, and best practices.

## Project Scope and Requirements:
1. The app should:
* Allow users to search for an artist by name
* Display song title, artist, album, and album art
* Load a maximum of 25 songs initially
* Play a preview of the selected song
* Display a media player on top of the song list
* Provide a play/pause button for song control
* Indicate the currently playing song in the list
* Ensure the song continues playing when navigating away from it

2. Project Timeline:
The estimated timeline for the project is 11 working days, with a total of 88 hours of work. [TODO list](TODO.md)

3. Development Strategy:

* Use the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for implementing features
* Employ end-to-end testing for simulating user interactions
* Use branches and trunk-based development for version control
* Ensure the app follows best security practices
* Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) for automated testing and deployment

4. Development Steps:

* Set up the project environment

* Design the UI

* Implement the main components

* Connect to the iTunes Search API

* Implement app functionality

* Write tests

* Optimize performance and user experience

* Implement security best practices

* Prepare for deployment

* Create documentation

* Deploy the app

5. Branching Strategy:
Use feature branches for each major component or functionality, with names like "feature/search-bar", "feature/song-list", "feature/media-player", and "feature/api-integration". Merge these branches into the main branch upon completion and successful review.

6. Testing Strategy:

* Write unit tests for individual components and functions
* Develop integration tests for the app's main features and API calls
* Create end-to-end tests to simulate user interactions and ensure the app works as expected

7. Security Best Practices:
* Secure data storage and API authentication
* Validate and sanitize user input
* Keep dependencies up-to-date and review third-party libraries

8. Deployment Strategy:
* Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
* Configure the app for production builds
* Build and test the app on Android and iOS platforms
* Publish the app to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store

## Conclusion:
This analysis document outlines the strategy and approach for implementing the Mooosic App, considering the requirements, constraints, and best practices. By following this plan, we aim to deliver a high-quality, secure, and user-friendly music player app that meets the expectations of the challenge.
